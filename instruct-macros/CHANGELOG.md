### V0.1.3

Fixed a bug with the description and updated the docs to support extraction of struct description

### v0.1.2 (2024-06-22)

Abstracted out types for the package to a second crate at `instruct-macro-types`! This allows you to use the procedural macro and get information on the types at runtime

### v0.1.1 (2024-06-22)

Published our first version to crates.io! Implementation is closely tied to the `Instructor` package for now with a goal to decouple this moving forward.
